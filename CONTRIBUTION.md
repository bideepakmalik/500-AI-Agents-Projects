## How to contribute

There are several ways to contribute:

- Open an issue to report bugs, request features, or propose new project ideas.
- Submit a pull request (PR) with improvements, bug fixes, documentation updates, or new projects.
- Help review open PRs and provide constructive feedback.

Before submitting substantial changes (like new project additions), please open an issue first to discuss the idea with maintainers.

## Code style and standards

- Follow consistent formatting. Where appropriate, add or update linting configuration files (e.g., .prettierrc, .eslintrc) so automatic formatting is used.
- Write clear, concise code with comments where necessary.
- Keep project-level READMEs up to date. Each project folder should include a README.md describing purpose, setup, usage, and license.

## Branching and commits

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch off main. Name branches as feature/short-description or fix/short-description.
- Keep changes focused and small; one logical change per PR makes review easier.
- Use descriptive commit messages. Prefer the format:

  type: short description

  Where type is one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

Example: "feat: add sample multi-agent example"

## Issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Use clear titles and provide steps to reproduce if reporting bugs. Include environment details and relevant logs or errors.
- For feature requests, explain the motivation and suggested behavior.

## Pull requests

- Link related issues in the PR description using "Fixes #<issue-number>" when appropriate.
- Describe what the PR does, why it is needed, and any tradeoffs.
- Update or add tests and documentation as needed.
- Keep PRs draft if you want feedback before finalizing.

## Tests

- Where applicable, include automated tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Describe test steps in the PR if automated tests are not available.

## Review and merge process

- Maintainers will review PRs and may request changes. Address review comments and push follow-up commits.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR. We use a non-fast-forward merge strategy to preserve PR history when appropriate.

## Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead, contact the repository owner directly or use GitHub's private security advisory feature.

## Code of conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to follow a respectful and inclusive code of conduct. Be constructive and courteous in issues and reviews.
